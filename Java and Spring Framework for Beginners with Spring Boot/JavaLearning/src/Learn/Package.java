public class Package {
	// putting similar java files in same folder is structuring. and in java we call
	// folder a package.

	// when we use ArrayList, we import it from java.util, where java and util are
	// folders/packages.
	// every java class imports java.lang.* by default even if you don't mention it.
	// 'System' from println statement gets imported from it.

	// when you want your code to be used by many other people, you make library of
	// that and publish it.
