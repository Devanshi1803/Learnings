# Learnings
This Repository contains my learning of new technology. 

1) Declarative and Imperative Programming? <br>
    Declarative -> what program does? <br>
    Imperative -> what program does? + How it does? (step by step instructions)

2) JSX?<br>
   JSX allows to write HTML elements in Javascript. <br>
   It converts HTML tags into react elements. Vue JSX transform is different from React's JSX trasform. <br>
   [check basic difference of react JSX and vue template](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reacts-jsx-vs-vue-s-templates-a-showdown-on-the-front-end-b00a70470409/#:~:text=Vue%20takes%20a%20different%20approach,file%2C%20while%20Vue%20templates%20are.)

3) Composable code?<br>
    Instead of writing all the code in one single file, write it in different reusable components.This design pattern allows one     to build applications more quickly and easily
