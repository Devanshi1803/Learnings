# Learnings
This Repository contains my learning of new technology. 

1) Declarative and Imperative Programming? <br>
    Declarative -> what program does? <br>
    Imperative -> what program does? + How it does? (step by step instructions)

2) JSX?<br>
   JSX allows to write HTML elements in Javascript. <br>
   It converts HTML tags into react elements. Vue JSX transform is different from React's JSX trasform. <br>
   [check basic difference of react JSX and vue template](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reacts-jsx-vs-vue-s-templates-a-showdown-on-the-front-end-b00a70470409/#:~:text=Vue%20takes%20a%20different%20approach,file%2C%20while%20Vue%20templates%20are.)

3) Composable code?<br>
    Instead of writing all the code in one single file, write it in different reusable components.This design pattern allows one     to build applications more quickly and easily

4) IDE- integrated development environment<br>
    It allows you to write code, compile it, run it or debug it 

5) [JDK/JVM/JRE?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-jdk-and-jre-in-java/)

6) [jshell?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jshell-java-9-new-feature/)

7) Java is  platform-independent(WORA-> write once, run anywhere) language, but JVM is platform-dependent. So, we need to convert Java code to byte code(.class file when you compile your .java file) as JVM understands byte code. Java compiler converts Java code to byte code and gives it to JVM. JVM runs the project based on file dependencies but will start running code from the file having main method of specific signature(public static void main(string args[])). \
    To run Java code written on your machine to others, you will only need JVM+libraries i.e., JRE.. you don't need JDK compulsory.
